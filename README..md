)
```

### Adding Stakeholders
```clarity
(contract-call? .fairshare propose-share-change
    u1                  ;; content-id
    'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM  ;; stakeholder
    u25                 ;; 25% share

## Security Considerations

- All functions include input validation
- Multi-signature requirement for critical changes
- Time-locked proposals
- Protected against common attack vectors
- Arithmetic overflow protection
